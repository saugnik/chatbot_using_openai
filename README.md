Chatbot for Website Content Retrieval
This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot capable of answering questions based on content retrieved from multiple web pages. The content is processed, split into manageable chunks, and stored in a vector store for fast retrieval. LangChain and OpenAI are used to build the backend of the chatbot, which leverages advanced techniques like document splitting, embeddings, and question-answering chains.

Project Overview
The Chatbot for Website Content Retrieval uses web scraping to gather content from specific URLs, processes the data using LangChain’s document loaders and text splitters, and stores the resulting text in a vector database using FAISS for efficient information retrieval. This allows the chatbot to respond accurately to user queries based on the specific content of the websites.

Key Features
Data Collection: The content from various URLs (such as blog posts or research papers) is loaded using LangChain's UnstructuredURLLoader.
Text Processing: The text is split into smaller chunks for easier handling and retrieval using LangChain's CharacterTextSplitter.
Embeddings: The content is converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI’s model.
Vector Store: The processed text is stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity-based search.
Question Answering: A question-answering chain is built using the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain, allowing users to ask questions related to the content and get relevant answers.
Technologies Used
LangChain: A framework for building NLP applications with LLMs.
OpenAI: Used for generating embeddings and powering the chatbot’s question-answering capabilities.
FAISS: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of vectors.
Python: The primary programming language used to implement the solution.
Workflow
URL Loading: URLs containing relevant content are loaded using UnstructuredURLLoader.
Text Splitting: The loaded content is split into smaller chunks using CharacterTextSplitter to make the data manageable.
Embeddings: OpenAI’s embeddings model is used to convert the chunks of text into vector representations.
Vector Store: The vectors are stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
QA Chain: A retrieval-based question-answering chain is created using LangChain’s RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.
Answering Queries: The chatbot is able to answer questions based on the vector store’s
